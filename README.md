# Board Games
<h3>Project Specifications</h3>
Date Started: August 4, 2022<br>
Programming Language: Java 18<br>
Build System:	IntelliJ<br>
JDK: Eclipse Termurin v17.0.4<br>
Last Updated: September 16, 2022<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The program allows the user to play different board games in the console, using user
  input to move the pieces and update the board accordingly. Each game requires two
  players. I developed this program to practice the principles of object-oriented programming,
  create algorithms to tackle complicated problems (such as finding the legal moves of the
  pieces when factoring in pins and checks), and develop good documentation habits.</p>
<h3>How to Run the Project</h3>
<p>Download the board game folder and import the project to any IDE. The program can now be run.
  To display the chess board properly, depending on what OS is being used, it may be
  recommended to set the console font to Segoe UI Symbol. </p>
<h3>Current Update</h3>
<p>The implementation of chess is nearly complete, and can be playtested freely. If you encounter
  any bugs, feel free to let me know!</p>
